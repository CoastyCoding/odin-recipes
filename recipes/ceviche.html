    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        In its essence, Peruvian ceviche starts with impeccably fresh fish or seafood, such as corvina, sea bass, shrimp, or mixed seafood. The fish or seafood is cut into bite-sized pieces and then delicately marinated in freshly squeezed lime juice, which not only imparts a bright acidity but also "cooks" the raw fish, rendering it tender and opaque. To enhance the flavor profile, thinly sliced red onions are added for their crisp texture and subtle bite, while diced tomatoes contribute sweetness and juiciness. Traditional Peruvian ceviche often incorporates a kick of heat from finely chopped ají amarillo or rocoto peppers, lending a spicy complexity to the dish. Cilantro, a staple herb in Peruvian cuisine, adds a refreshing herbal note, complementing the citrusy marinade. Finally, the ceviche is seasoned with a touch of salt and pepper to taste, allowing the natural flavors of the ingredients to shine through.

        Served chilled and garnished with slices of creamy avocado and a sprinkle of vibrant cilantro leaves, Peruvian ceviche is a feast for the senses. It's commonly enjoyed as an appetizer or light meal, accompanied by crunchy corn kernels (cancha) or sweet potato slices for textural contrast. With its vibrant colors, bold flavors, and tantalizing aroma, Peruvian ceviche embodies the culinary diversity and cultural richness of Peru, making it a beloved dish both locally and internationally. Whether enjoyed by the sea breeze along Peru's coastline or recreated in kitchens around the world, Peruvian ceviche is a true celebration of fresh ingredients and culinary craftsmanship.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound (450g) fresh fish or seafood (such as tilapia, halibut, shrimp, scallops, or a combination)</li>
        <li>4-6 limes, juiced (enough to cover the fish or seafood)</li>
        <li>1 red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1-2 jalapeño peppers, seeded and finely chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Tortilla chips or toasted corn for serving</li>
        <li>2 slices of sweet potatos</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Fish or Seafood:
            <ul>
                Rinse the fish or seafood under cold water and pat it dry with paper towels.
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>
                Cut the fish or seafood into small, bite-sized pieces. If using shrimp, you can leave them whole or cut them in half.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Marinate in Citrus Juice:
            <ul>
                In a non-reactive bowl (glass or ceramic), place the fish or seafood pieces in a single layer.
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>
                Squeeze enough lime juice to completely cover the fish or seafood. Make sure the juice fully covers the pieces to ensure proper marination.
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>
                Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it marinate in the refrigerator for about 20-30 minutes. The acid in the lime juice will "cook" the fish or seafood, turning it opaque and firm.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Prepare the Vegetables:
            <ul>
                While the fish or seafood is marinating, prepare the vegetables. Thinly slice the red onion, dice the tomatoes, and finely chop the jalapeño peppers.
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>
                Rinse the chopped cilantro leaves and set aside.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Combine Ingredients:
            <ul>
                Once the fish or seafood has marinated, drain off most of the lime juice, leaving just enough to keep the ceviche moist.
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>
                Add the sliced red onion, diced tomatoes, chopped jalapeño peppers (if using), and chopped cilantro to the bowl with the fish or seafood.
            </ul>            
            <br>
            <ul>
                Season with salt and pepper to taste.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Mix and Chill:
            <ul>
                Gently toss all the ingredients together until well combined.
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>
                Cover the bowl again and refrigerate the ceviche for an additional 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Serve:
            <ul>
                Serve the ceviche chilled, garnished with slices of avocado if desired. (optional)
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>
                Serve with tortilla chips or toasted corn on the side for scooping up the ceviche.
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>
                Enjoy your homemade ceviche immediately as a refreshing appetizer or light meal!
