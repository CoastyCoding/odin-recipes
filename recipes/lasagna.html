    <p>
        To make lasagna, start by gathering all the necessary ingredients and preheating your oven to 375째F (190째C). Cook the lasagna noodles in boiling salted water until they are al dente, then drain and set them aside. In a large skillet, brown ground beef or Italian sausage, then add chopped onions and minced garlic, cooking until the onions are translucent. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, black pepper, and optional crushed red pepper flakes, allowing the sauce to simmer for about 10-15 minutes. In a separate bowl, mix ricotta cheese, egg, and grated Parmesan cheese. To assemble the lasagna, spread a layer of meat sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish, then layer noodles, ricotta mixture, mozzarella cheese, and meat sauce. Repeat the layering process, finishing with a layer of noodles topped with sauce and mozzarella cheese. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned. Let it rest for 10-15 minutes before serving.

    <p>Once baked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. This allows the layers to set and makes slicing easier. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired. Serve slices of the delicious lasagna hot, and enjoy the rich flavors and comforting textures.
