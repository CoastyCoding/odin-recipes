    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    To create an authentic New York-style pizza, start by preparing the dough. In a large mixing bowl, combine bread flour, water, yeast, salt, and a bit of sugar. Knead the dough until it's smooth and elastic, then divide it into balls and let them rise for several hours at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator. When ready to assemble the pizza, preheat your oven as high as it will go, ideally around 500°F (260°C), and place a pizza stone or baking sheet inside to heat up. Take one of the dough balls and stretch it out into a thin, round shape, leaving the edges slightly thicker to form the characteristic crust. Place the stretched dough onto a lightly floured pizza peel or the back of a baking sheet dusted with cornmeal.

    <br>
    <p>Now it's time to add the toppings. Start by spreading a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving about half an inch of crust around the edges. Next, sprinkle a generous amount of shredded whole milk mozzarella cheese over the sauce. Feel free to customize your toppings with traditional options like pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers, or get creative with your favorite ingredients. Once the pizza is topped to your liking, carefully slide it onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven. Bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned. Remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool for a minute or two, then slice and serve hot. Enjoy the classic flavors and irresistible chewy crust of your homemade New York-style pizza!</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Dough:
            <ul>
                In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy.
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>Add the flour, salt, and olive oil to the yeast mixture. Stir until a rough dough forms.</ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Prepare the Sauce:
            <ul>
                In a small bowl, mix together the crushed or pureed San Marzano tomatoes with dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper to taste. Set aside.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Preheat the Oven and Pizza Stone:
            <ul>
                Preheat your oven to its highest temperature setting, typically around 500°F (260°C). Place a pizza stone in the oven while it preheats to allow it to become very hot.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Shape the Dough:
            <ul>
                Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into two equal portions.
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>
                On a floured surface, stretch or roll out each portion of dough into a thin circle, about 12 inches in diameter, leaving a slightly thicker edge for the crust.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Assemble the Pizza:
            <ul>
                Sprinkle cornmeal or semolina flour onto a pizza peel or the back of a baking sheet.
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>
                Carefully transfer one of the stretched dough rounds onto the prepared surface.
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>
                Spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>
                Arrange the sliced or shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce and cheese to top it off.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake the Pizza:
            <ul>
                Slide the assembled pizza onto the preheated pizza stone in the oven.
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>
                Bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>
                Remove the pizza from the oven using the pizza peel or a large spatula.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Serve and Enjoy:
            <ul>
                Allow the pizza to cool for a few minutes before slicing.
Serve hot and enjoy your delicious New York-style pizza!
